# Deployment

## Deploy by Docker

1. install docker
2. run 'docker compose up' at the root folder

The service should then be available at localhost:8080.

Running 'docker compose up' the first time may take around 50 minutes with more than 35 minutes spent on building opencv for the server (as of 2021/09/25 on a personal computer).
